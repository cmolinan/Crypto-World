# Crypto World - A Metrics WebApp
This React/Redux Capstone Project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values), working with real live data from an  API.

For this, I chose to make a webApp that shows online information, coming from the company CoinGecko, about the hundred most important Cryptocurrencies of the moment, also showing some of their detailed data.‚Äã

    { 
      components, events, states, hooks, 
      props, router, stores, actions/reducers, API, etc
    }
